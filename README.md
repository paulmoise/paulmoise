# Hi there, I'm Paul Moïse 👋

🎓 I'm a final-year Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Avignon, with a passion for applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems.  
🧠 My work focuses on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Generative AI**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — from fine-tuning and deploying models to building AI-powered applications in industry.

💻 I have 1.5 years of experience as a **Full-Stack Software Developer**, working with **Django REST Framework** for backend and **React** for frontend.

🔍 I'm deeply curious about the **inner workings of AI models** — how they learn, generalize, and can be optimized for real-world tasks.

🚀 My goal: becoming a **ML/AI Engineer** — ready to tackle practical challenges in AI and make a positive impact.

## 💡 What I'm working on
- 🌐 Building an **LLM-based chatbot** at Amadeus, enabling natural language queries over 1,200+ pages of functional specs using RAG architecture.
- 🎯 Exploring **LLM optimization** (LoRA, quantization) for low-resource African languages.
- 🏗️ Designing scalable and explainable AI pipelines for industry applications.
